# REQUEST
> ANALYZE, FORMULATE, REVIEW, AND BEGIN POPULATING THE MISSING DATA FOR THE MACHINE CREATOR PSEUDO CODE FORMAT
> TODO: POPULATE AND LINK `{4}:alias_defs` WITH REQUIRED ALIAS THRROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT. CURRENTLY DUPE MOCK DATA FROM {2}
> TODO: ENSURE THE STRUCTURE IS FOLLOWED, ENSURE LINKS ARE CONNECTED.
> NOTES: THIS FORMAT IS CREATED FOR A BROAD SCOPE, SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TASK OF CONTEXT AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN INTELLIGENCES UTILIZING BALANCE.

## PRE-PROMPT
- {1}:pesudo_code standards format is designed EXPLICITLY to strike a balance for IDE AGENT CONFIGS:
    [a] INTERACTIVE IDE AGENT CONFIGS
      [i] [cursor-ide] (.cursorrules)
      [ii] [claude-code](.CLAUDE.md)
      [iii] [codex](AGENTS.md)
      [iiii] [windsurf](.windsurfrules)
      [vii] [gemini](GEMINI.md)
- {2}:
  - Review, and correct any inconsistentcies or errors. i made this up, so there is going to be imperfections. Im not looking for accuracy, or optimization, im looking for TECHINICALLY INTEGRATED FORMAT COMPLETION, WITH FULL UNDERSTANDING.
- {3}:
  - mecha_god is AT ITS CORE a LIGHTWEIGHT, STRAIGHTFARWARDW, SIMPLE YET EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE, OPTIMIZED FORMAT. IT FILLS A MIDDLE GROUND GAP BETWEEN MACHINE INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE IN A FORMAT THAT IS IMMEDIATELY UNDERSTANDABLE TO BOTH FORMATS OF UNDERSTANDING.
  - [MACHINE-INTELLIGENCE](LINKED-AND-ABBREVIATED) -> [HUMAN-INTELLIGENCE](REINFORCED OPERATORS, UNDERSTANDABLE PRESENTATION, LOW CLUTTER, HIGH ORGANIZATION CODE BLOCKS)
  - **mech_god(machion_of_creation) FORMAT IS DESIGNED TO OPTIMIZE AI AND HUMAN COMMUNICATION, CLOSING THE GAP IN MISCOMMUNICATIONS**
  - **IT IS NOT DESIGNED TO BE SYNTAX PERFECT, OR FUNCTIONAL, FOR ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN OPTIMIZED DELIVERY FOR MACHINE CONSUMPTION.**
  - **IT HAS NO OFFICIAL LANGUAGE, I MARK IT WITH YAML FOR SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING, BUT OFFICIALY IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS `.mech` extension**
- {4}:balance
  - [a]:STRAIGHTFORWARD_SIMPLICITY
    - [i]: designing a format that is straight forward enough
    - [ii]: follows enough simple patterns that the format requires no explanation
  - [b]:FORMAT_COMPLEXITY - _Adding to much context will render the format ignored or redundant buy the consuming machine intelligence
    - [i]:if the format is too complex, the ai will have to train it, review it, or learn it in general, rendering it redundant.
    - [ii]:designed to enhance current workflow and infractructure of leading LLM models like OpenAI ChatGPT 5  or Anthropic Sonnet 4.5 thinking model.
